Cities3D is a cross-platform implementation of the board game Settlers of Catan
with all expansions, including Seafarers, and Cities & Knights.  It displays 
the game world in 3 dimensions, with rotation, panning, and zooming, in bright 
beautiful textures contributed to the project freely by talented individuals 
from around the world.  The user interface is entirely custom drawn, with 
crisp, clean lines and dozens of high-quality bitmaps to facilitate an 
intuitive, pleasing experience for users.  Cities3D has an extensible plugin 
architecture that allows new rules and variants to be added into the game 
without changing an ounce of code in existing rules or variants.  In fact, the 
core rules themselves for Settlers, and the expansions, are all plugins.

Cities3D is built on the firm foundation of OpenGL (http://www.opengl.org), 
wxWidgets (http://www.wxWidgets.org) and boost (http://www.boost.org), all 
real-world solutions that have been used in production code.  The architecture 
was built with a lot of thought, and a lot of Design Patterns, in an attempt to
make a truly exceptional object-oriented system.  The sound library is 
fmod (http://www.fmod.org), and the unit testing is done with 
cppunit (http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi).  The source code 
documentation was created using NaturalDocs (http://www.naturaldocs.org).
